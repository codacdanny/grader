CGPA CALCULATOR APP 
Overview
This app helps you to compute your grades easily and saves them for you in a database where you can easily access the data anytime you wish.
This app was built with CREATE-REACT-APP.

The primary purpose of this project is to fully understand how React works, understand Javascript pointers, Global state management in React, UseEffect and useReducer hooks, UseContext, and finally Authentication.

The aim of this app Is to make it easier for students to access their grades with any device from anywhere. 

While building this project I learned how to transverse through complex javascript data structures, and I learned how to actually implement different javascript methods in a complex way especially the reduce() method.

Technologies used in this project:
React, Chakra UI, Firebase(for authentication and real-time data storage), CSS, javascript, react-Icons.
